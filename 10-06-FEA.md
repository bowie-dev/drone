# Finite Element Analysis  10/06/2025
## FEA Purpose
 - To determine if the initial frame design has any unforseen flaws in regard to points of excess stress, strain or deformation within the expected usage bounds.
## FEA Findings

 - It was found that the initial design had points where the stress had reached 30mPa in some edge conditions of the expected usage case, 30mPa is approaching/at the limit of PLA so those points need to be further optimised.
 - The high stress points were often near sharp edges on the frame as seen below

## FEA Redesign
 - The frame was redesigned to minimise high stress points and to improve strength. Sharp points on the model that caused spikes in stress were rounded or developed to include more material
 - Further FEA may be used to remove unnessecary material and for topological optimisation.
