# Finite Element Analysis 10/06/2025
## Purpose
 - To determine if the initial frame design has any unforseen flaws in regard to points of excess stress, strain or deformation within the expected usage bounds.
## Findings
 - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowie-dev/drone/refs/heads/main/img/fea1.png)
 - It was found that the initial design had points where the stress had reached 30mPa in some edge conditions of the expected usage case, 30mPa is approaching/at the limit of PLA so those points need to be further optimised.
 - The high stress points were often near sharp edges on the frame as seen below
