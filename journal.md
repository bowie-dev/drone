DD/MM/YY
## 07/06/25 - Day 1
 - Initial research into parts, shape, size, components, requirements
 - Brainstorming and initial design
 - Mock wiring diagram

## 08/06/25 - Day 2
 - Determine what parts are needed
 - Further work on frame design and CAD assembly
 - Further research into flight controller and camera component design

## 09/06/25 - Day 3
 - Look into part sourcing
 - Design components in CAD to help brainstorm part fitment and orientation

## 10/06/25 - Day 4
 - Source camera and transmitter
 - Further develop frame design
 - FEA (Finite element analysis) to determine physical limits of frame and current setup
 - CFD (computational flow dynamics) to determine aerodynamic properties of current design
 - Camera mounting brainstorm
 - PLEASE ALSO READ [Day 4 Documentation](https://github.com/bowie-dev/drone/blob/main/journal-10-06.md)

## 21/06/25 - Day 5
 - Find alternative for camera and transmitter as it had sold out
 - Rethink camera mounting onto frame
 - Research part sourcing to minimise costs + shipping

## 22/06/25 - Day 6
 - Design wiring layout and brainstorm pseudocode for flight controller
 - Begin the final BOM in csv layout

## 25/06/25 - Day 7
 - Finalize BOM
 - Finalize Wiring Layout
 - Develop README.md
