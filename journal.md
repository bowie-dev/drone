 - ![raspi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74b47ad9-b769-4c41-9d57-c82ef967327c)

## 10/06/25 - Day 4 ~4h
 - Source camera and transmitter
 - Further develop frame design
 - FEA (Finite element analysis) to determine physical limits of frame and current setup (read document below)
 - CFD (computational flow dynamics) to determine aerodynamic properties of current design (read document below)
 - Camera mounting brainstorm (read document below)
 - PLEASE ALSO READ [Day 4 Documentation](https://github.com/bowie-dev/drone/blob/main/journal-10-06.md)

## 21/06/25 - Day 5 ~2h
 - Find alternative for camera and transmitter as it had sold out
 - Rethink camera mounting onto frame
 - Research part sourcing to minimise costs + shipping
